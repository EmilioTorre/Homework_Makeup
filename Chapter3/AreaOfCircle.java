 * 3.11.2 Write a program that prompts the user to enter the radius of a circle and calculates the area for that circle. The program should check the entered number. if the entered number is negative, the program prints Invalid Entry, the radius should be positive and quits. Otherwise, the program should calculate the area of the circle and prints The area of a circle with radius "the radius value entered by the user" is "The calculated value of the circle area". (Hint: Circle area = Ï€ * radius * radius)
